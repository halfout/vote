# vote
Do we like who we are voting for?  Can we fix this?

The point of this project is to compare approval polls to the usual polls.  

These are programs written to download polling data and plot it.  Also, there is hand-entered data.  

The programs are named favorX.R

Also, there is one program that uses knitr, favor7 - senate html.Rhtml

Plots are made in svg files in the figures folder.

Data sets are in the PollX.csv files, and in the input_versus.csv and input_favor.csv files.
